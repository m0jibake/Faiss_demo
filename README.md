# Faiss_demo

#### This gives a quick intro to Faiss and demonstrates two algorithms (Voronoi cells and index partitioning using local sensitive hashing) to trade speed for accuracy

### How can I make this run?

- A_create_embeddings.ipynb: This notebook builds the index embeddings by transforming the movie plots into vectors using Bert. This notebook can't be executed as I had to remove the raw data files from this repo due to file size restrictions.
- B_Similarity_Search.ipynb: Main notebook and can be executed.
